# Marvel Database

A MySQL database of Marvel _projects_, _timelines_, and _characters_, developed for my IN1013 Databases coursework. The database allows you to view and sort information, such as movies in release or timeline order and which character appeared in which projects.

## Learning Outcomes

* Expanded SQL knowledge
* Advanced database concepts and SQL commands
* Create, insert, and delet tables and views
* Manipulate data using complex SQl queries
