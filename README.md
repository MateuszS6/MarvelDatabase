# Marvel Database
A MySQL database of Marvel projects, timelines, and characters, developed for my IN1013 Databases coursework. The database allows you to view and sort information, such as movies in release or timeline order and which character appeared in which projects.

## Learning Outcomes
* Expanded existing SQL knowledge
* Learned advanced database concepts and SQL commands
* Created, inserted into, and deleted tables and views
* Manipulated data using complex SQl queries
